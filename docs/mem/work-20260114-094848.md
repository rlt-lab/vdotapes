# Work Session: Code Review Task List Generation

**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Duration:** ~15 minutes

## Summary

Analyzed the comprehensive code review document and generated a detailed, actionable task list with 146 checkboxed items for implementing suggested fixes and improvements.

## What Was Accomplished

- Launched 6 parallel subagents to analyze each section of COMPREHENSIVE_CODE_REVIEW.md:
  - Performance Issues
  - Dead Code Analysis
  - Code Redundancy
  - Main Process Code Quality
  - Renderer/Frontend Code Quality
  - Database Layer Issues

- Created `CODE_REVIEW_TASKS.md` consolidating all findings with:
  - 146 actionable tasks with checkboxes
  - File paths and line numbers for each issue
  - Priority levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
  - Code examples for fixes
  - 7-phase implementation plan

## Key Findings

| Category | Tasks | Critical Issues |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Quick Wins | 6 | - |
| Performance | 20 | 3 (sync I/O, grid re-render, sequential IPC) |
| Dead Code | 33 | - |
| Redundancy | 25 | - |
| Main Process | 18 | 1 (rollback error handling) |
| Renderer | 20 | - |
| Database | 24 | 1 (rollback errors silently ignored) |

## Key Decisions Made

- Organized tasks in priority order with Quick Wins first for immediate impact
- Identified 5 new utility files to create for code consolidation
- Established 7-phase implementation timeline spanning ~4 weeks
- Marked 4 orphan files as safe to delete immediately

## Next Steps

1. Start with Quick Wins (< 1 hour each, high impact):
   - Parallelize IPC calls in renderer.js
   - Clear recovery interval on shutdown
   - Add composite database indexes
   - Cache getAllVideoTags()

2. Address CRITICAL issues:
   - Fix transaction rollback error handling
   - Replace synchronous file I/O

3. Work through remaining phases as outlined in CODE_REVIEW_TASKS.md

## Files Created/Modified

- Created: `CODE_REVIEW_TASKS.md` - Comprehensive task list with 146 items
