## Summary
Completed all remaining LOW severity code review fixes from the performance optimization plan (Phase 5.3), bringing the implementation to full completion except for manual testing.

## Accomplished
- Updated CLAUDE.md to document new TypeScript files (`video-scanner-ts.ts`, `thumbnail-gen-ts.ts`) and removed references to deleted Rust native modules
- Standardized logging prefixes in `video-scanner-ts.ts`: changed `[VideoScannerTS]` to `[VideoScanner]` (2 instances)
- Removed ~91 lines of unused conversion functions from `video-scanner.ts` (`convertNativeVideoToRecord()`, `convertNativeScanResult()`, and related interfaces)
- Updated PERFORMANCE_TASKS.md to mark Phase 5.3 as complete

## Key Decisions
- Used parallel subagents to complete all three LOW severity tasks simultaneously for efficiency

## Current Status
All implementation phases complete:
- Phase 1: Quick Wins ✅
- Phase 2: Grid Virtualization ⚠️ (Disabled - CSS Grid incompatible)
- Phase 3: Replace Rust with TypeScript ✅
- Phase 4.1-4.2: Type check & Build ✅
- Phase 5: Code Review Fixes ✅ (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW all complete)
- Phase 6: Runtime Performance Fixes ✅

## Next Steps
- Run `npm run dev` and perform manual testing with a 10k video collection
- Verify: folder scan non-blocking, thumbnails generate, sort <100ms, expanded view <100ms, smooth 60fps scroll
- Mark Phase 4.3 Functionality items as complete after verification
