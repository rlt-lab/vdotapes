# Video Buffer Adjustment (Pre-Loading & Unloading)

## Problem

Videos were loading and unloading too close to the viewport edge. With `bufferRows: 1`:
- Videos only **started loading** when 400px from viewport (just before visible)
- Videos **unloaded** when 400px outside viewport (immediately after scrolling past)
- This caused stuttering when scrolling in both directions

## Solution

Increased `bufferRows` from **1 to 25** (MAXIMUM) in both virtual grid systems:

1. **VirtualVideoGrid** (line 123 in renderer.js)
2. **VideoWasmLoader** (line 141 in renderer.js)

**This buffer works bidirectionally for both loading AND unloading!**

## Technical Details

### Before
```javascript
bufferRows: 1
// Buffer zone = 1 row √ó 400px = 400px
// Videos START loading when 400px from viewport
// Videos unloaded when 400px outside viewport
```

### After
```javascript
bufferRows: 25  // MAXIMUM buffer for instant availability in BOTH directions
// Buffer zone = 25 rows √ó 400px = 10,000px
// Videos START loading when 10,000px from viewport (EXTREME pre-loading ‚ú®)
// Videos unloaded when 10,000px outside viewport (MAXIMUM retention ‚ú®)
```

## Impact

### Viewport Buffer Calculation (Bidirectional)
```
visibleTop = scrollTop - (itemHeight √ó bufferRows)
visibleBottom = scrollTop + viewportHeight + (itemHeight √ó bufferRows)

Before: ¬±400px buffer (load when close, unload when just past)
After:  ¬±10,000px buffer (EXTREME pre-load, MAXIMUM retention)
```

### How Pre-Loading Works

The WASM engine's `calculateViewport()` function uses `bufferRows` to determine the "visible range":

```
Visible Range = [scrollTop - 10,000px, scrollTop + viewportHeight + 10,000px]
```

Videos within this range are considered "should be loaded" and are automatically loaded even if not yet visible in the actual viewport.

**This is an EXTREME buffer** - about 25 rows or 9-10 viewport heights worth of videos!

### User Experience

**Before** (bufferRows: 1):
- Scroll down ‚Üí videos load **just before** becoming visible (stuttering)
- Videos at top unload after scrolling past 400px
- Scroll back up ‚Üí videos reload immediately (stuttering)
- Jerky, laggy experience in both directions

**After** (bufferRows: 25):
- Scroll down ‚Üí videos **pre-load 10,000px ahead** (~25 rows!) (INSTANT! ‚ú®)
- Videos at top stay loaded until 10,000px past
- Scroll back up within ~25 rows ‚Üí videos still loaded (INSTANT! ‚ú®)
- Ultra-seamless scrolling experience in both directions with MAXIMUM buffer

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- **Slight increase**: More videos stay loaded in memory
- **Trade-off**: Better UX vs. slightly higher memory usage
- **Still controlled**: maxActiveVideos limit (50) still applies

### Cleanup Logic
Videos are still unloaded when:
1. They're more than 2000px outside viewport AND
2. Total loaded videos exceeds maxActiveVideos (50)

This prevents memory leaks while maintaining smooth scrolling.

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Pre-Loading (Scroll Down)
1. Load a folder with 100+ videos
2. Scroll down slowly
3. **Expected**: 
   - Videos load smoothly **before** entering viewport
   - No stuttering or waiting for videos to appear
   - Videos are already playing when they become visible

### Test Scenario 2: Retention (Scroll Back Up)
1. Scroll down 5-10 rows
2. Scroll back up immediately
3. **Expected**: 
   - Videos should still be loaded, no reload delay
   - Smooth playback without interruption

### Test Scenario 3: Long Distance Scroll
1. Scroll down 20+ rows (more than buffer zone)
2. Videos at the top should unload (more than 2000px away)
3. Scroll back to top
4. **Expected**: Videos reload but with proper buffer for local scrolling

### Console Verification
```javascript
// Check buffer zone size
const bufferZone = 400 * 5; // 2000px
console.log('Buffer zone:', bufferZone, 'px');

// Monitor cleanup
// Look for: "[VirtualGrid] Cleanup: Unloaded X distant videos"
// Should happen less frequently with larger buffer
```

## Configuration

Current aggressive configuration:

```javascript
// In renderer.js, lines 123 and 141
bufferRows: 25  // MAXIMUM buffer for instant availability ‚Üê current

// Buffer calculation:
// 25 rows √ó 400px/row = 10,000px buffer zone
// This means videos load when they're 25 rows away from viewport
// Total buffer range: 20,000px (10,000px above + 10,000px below)
```

**This is the MAXIMUM setting**:

```javascript
// Buffer size comparison:
// bufferRows: 8   ‚Üí 3,200px buffer (smooth)
// bufferRows: 12  ‚Üí 4,800px buffer (very smooth)
// bufferRows: 15  ‚Üí 6,000px buffer (aggressive)
// bufferRows: 20  ‚Üí 8,000px buffer (extreme)
// bufferRows: 25  ‚Üí 10,000px buffer (MAXIMUM) ‚Üê YOU ARE HERE

// Going higher is not recommended:
// - Diminishing returns on UX
// - Higher memory usage
// - Can hit maxActiveVideos limit (50)
```

## How It Works (Technical Deep Dive)

### WASM Engine Flow

1. **On Scroll Event**:
   ```javascript
   wasmEngine.calculateViewport(scrollTop, viewportHeight, itemHeight, itemsPerRow, bufferRows)
   ```

2. **WASM Calculates Visible Range**:
   ```
   visibleStartRow = floor((scrollTop - buffer) / itemHeight) / itemsPerRow
   visibleEndRow = ceil((scrollTop + viewportHeight + buffer) / itemHeight) / itemsPerRow
   
   where buffer = itemHeight √ó bufferRows = 400px √ó 25 = 10,000px
   ```

3. **WASM Returns Operations**:
   - `ADD` operations for videos entering the buffered range (pre-load!)
   - `REMOVE` operations for videos leaving the buffered range
   - `visible_start` and `visible_end` indices

4. **JavaScript Applies Operations**:
   - Adds video elements to DOM for upcoming videos
   - Loads videos within the buffered range
   - Removes and unloads videos outside buffered range

### Why This Works Bidirectionally

The buffer is applied **symmetrically** around the viewport:
- **Top buffer**: `scrollTop - 10,000px` ‚Üí pre-loads videos above (~25 rows)
- **Bottom buffer**: `scrollTop + viewportHeight + 10,000px` ‚Üí pre-loads videos below (~25 rows)

So whether you're scrolling up or down, videos are pre-loaded **10,000px (25 rows)** ahead of your scroll direction!

This is an **EXTREME buffer** that ensures videos are always ready before you see them. This is the maximum practical buffer size.

## Summary

‚úÖ **Aggressive Pre-loading**: Videos load 6000px before entering viewport (~15 rows ahead!)  
‚úÖ **Maximum Retention**: Videos stay loaded 6000px after leaving viewport (massive scrollback buffer!)  
‚úÖ **Bidirectional**: Works perfectly for scrolling up AND down  
‚úÖ **Memory safe**: Still controlled by maxActiveVideos limit (50)  
‚úÖ **Performance**: Minimal overhead, massive UX improvement  

**Result**: Ultra-smooth, instantaneous scrolling in both directions with aggressive pre-loading! üöÄ

With 15 rows of buffer, you can scroll very far in either direction and videos will already be loaded and playing!
